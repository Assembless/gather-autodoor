## Additional Informations

### Why include Volta

[Volta][volta]’s toolchain always keeps track of where you are, it makes sure the tools you use always respect the settings of the project you’re working on. This means you don’t have to worry about changing the state of your installed software when switching between projects. For example, it's [used by engineers at LinkedIn][volta-tomdale] to standardize tools and have reproducible development environments.

I recommend to [install][volta-getting-started] Volta and use it to manage your project's toolchain.
